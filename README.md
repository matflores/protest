Protest is a tiny, simple, and easy-to-extend testing framework for ruby.

## Get it

```
gem install protest
```

## Usage

```ruby
require "protest"

Protest.describe "A user" do
  setup do
    @user = User.new(name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.org")
  end

  it "has a name" do
    assert_equal "John Doe", @user.name
  end

  it "has an email" do
    assert_equal "john@example.org", @user.email
  end
end
```

Use `Protest.context` or `Protest.describe` at the top level to define
a new test case. Inside the block, you can use `test`, `it` or `should`
for defining each individual test.

## Setup and teardown

If you need to run code before or after each test, declare a `setup` or
`teardown` block:

```ruby
Protest.context "A user" do
  setup do # this runs before each test
    @user = User.create(name: "John")
  end

  teardown do # this runs after each test
    @user.destroy
  end
end
```

`setup` and `teardown` blocks are evaluated in the same context as your test,
which means any instance variables defined in any of them are available in the
rest.

## Nested contexts

Break down your test into logical chunks with nested contexts:

```ruby
Protest.describe "A user" do
  setup do
    @user = User.make
  end

  context "when validating" do
    it "validates name" do
      @user.name = nil
      assert !@user.valid?
    end

    # etc, etc
  end

  context "doing something else" do
    # you get the idea
  end
end
```

Any `setup` or `teardown` blocks you defined in a context will run in that
context and in _any_ other context nested in it.

## Pending tests

There are two ways of marking a test as pending. You can declare a test with no
body:

```ruby
Protest.context "Some tests" do
  test "this test will be marked as pending"

  test "this tests is also pending"

  test "this test isn't pending" do
    assert true
  end
end
```

Or you can call the `pending` method from inside your test:

```ruby
Protest.context "Some tests" do
  test "this test is pending" do
    pending "oops, this doesn't work"
    assert false
  end
end
```

## Assertions

Protest includes just three basic assertion methods:

* assert(condition, message)

  Ensure that a condition is met, otherwise it raises an `AssertionFailed`
exception. The second argument is optional and it is used to override
the default failure message.

* assert_equal(expected, actual, message)

  Syntax sugar for `assert(expected == actual, message)`.

* assert_raise(exception, message) do ... end

  Passes if the code block raises the specified exception. If no exception
is specified, this assertion passes if _any_ exception is raised inside
the block. The second argument is optional and it is used to override
the default failure message.

## Custom assertions

If you want to add more assertion methods, just define new methods that
rely on `assert`.

For example:

```ruby
module AwesomenessAssertions
  def assert_awesomeness(object)
    assert object.awesome?, "#{object.inspect} is not awesome enough"
  end
end

class Protest::TestCase
  include AwesomenessAssertions
end
```

You could also define rspec-like matchers if you like that style. See
`matchers.rb` in the examples directory for an example.

## Reports

Protest can report the output of a test suite in many ways. The library ships
with a few reports defined by default.

You can select which report to use using the `report_with` method:

```ruby
Protest.report_with(:documentation)
Protest.report_with(:progress)
Protest.report_with(:my_awesome_custom_report)
```

By default, Protest will use the report defined in the `PROTEST_REPORT`
environment variable. If this variable is not defined, the Documentation
report will be used.

### Progress report

Use this report by calling `Protest.report_with(:progress)`.

The progress report will output the "classic" Test::Unit output of periods for
passing tests, "F" for failing assertions, "E" for unrescued exceptions, and
"P" for pending tests, in full color.

### Documentation report

Use this report by calling `Protest.report_with(:progress)`.

For each testcase in your suite, this will output the description of the test
case (whatever you passed to `TestCase.context`), followed by the name of each
test in that context, one per line. For example:

```ruby
Protest.context "A user" do
  test "has a name"
  test "has an email"

  context "validations" do
    test "ensure the email can't be blank"
  end
end
```

Will output, when run with the `:documentation` report:

```
A user
- has a name (Not Yet Implemented)
- has an email (Not Yet Implemented)

A user validations
- ensure the email can't be blank (Not Yet Implemented)
```

(The 'Not Yet Implemented' messages are because the tests have no body. See
"Pending tests", above.)

This is similar to the specdoc runner in [rspec](http://rspec.info).

### Summary report

Use this report by calling `Protest.report_with(:summary)`.

This report will output a brief summary with the total number of tests,
assertions, passed tests, pending tests, failed tests and errors.

### Turn report

Use this report by calling `Protest.report_with(:turn)`.

This report displays each test on a separate line with failures being displayed
immediately instead of at the end of the tests.

You might find this useful when running a large test suite, as it can be very
frustrating to see a failure (....F...) and then have to wait until all the
tests finish before you can see what the exact failure was.

This report is based on the output displayed by [TURN](http://github.com/TwP/turn),
Test::Unit Reporter (New) by Tim Pease.

### Defining your own reports

This is really, really easy. All you need to do is subclass `Report`, and
register your subclass by calling `Protest.add_report`. See the
documentation for details, or take a look at the source code for
`Protest::Reports::Progress` and `Protest::Reports::Documentation`.

## Failing Early

If needed, you can configure Protest to stop the execution when the first error
or failed assertion occurs.

This can be configured with the `fail_early` method:

```ruby
Protest.fail_early = true
```

This feature can be configured by passing a `PROTEST_FAIL_EARLY` environment
variable, to activate it you must set it to `"true"`.

### Command-Line

Protest comes with a command-line interface for running tests:

```
$ protest --help
Usage:
  protest --help             # Show this help text
  protest                    # Run all tests in test/**/*.rb
  protest DIR                # Run all tests in DIR/**/*.rb
  protest FILE1.rb FILE2.rb  # Run all tests in FILE1.rb and FILE2.rb
```
